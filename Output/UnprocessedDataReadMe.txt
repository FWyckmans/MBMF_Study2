Column explanation:

NS: Subject number

Trial: Trial number (we started the analyses from trial 10 to the end)

Step: Step 1 or Step 2 of the RL task.

Choice1 and Choice2: Indicate which choices were displayed at each step. Step 1 is always 1 (left) and 2 (right). Step 2 is whether 3/4 or 5/6.
			These columns are useful to compute transition.
			1 -> 3/4 = common transition
			1 -> 5/6 = rare transition
			2 -> 3/4 = rare transition
			2 -> 5/6 = common transition

Resp1: This column relates to two different things depending on the step! During step 1, it relates to the first step choice (1 or 2) ;
	During step 2, it relates to the probability of getting a reward with the left image in the second step (not really useful)

Resp 2: Relates to the response given during the second step (3, 4, 5, or 6).

Reward: Whether the trial is rewarded or not (1 = rewarded).

RT1: This column relates to two different things depending on the step! During Step1, it relates to the first step reaction time.
	During Step2, it relates to the reward probability of the right image in the second step (not really useful either).

RT2: Response time during the second step.
